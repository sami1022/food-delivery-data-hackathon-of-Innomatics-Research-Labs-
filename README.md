# Food Delivery Data Analysis Hackathon

## 📌 Overview
This project was completed as part of a technical hackathon for an Advanced Gen AI internship.  
The objective was to integrate data from multiple sources, create a unified dataset, and perform analytical queries to extract meaningful business insights.

---

## 📂 Datasets Used
The project uses three different data formats:

- **orders.csv** – Contains transactional order data
- **users.json** – Contains user details including city and membership information
- **restaurants.sql** – Contains restaurant metadata such as cuisine and ratings

---

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- SQLite (SQL)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for analysis & visualization)

---

## 🔗 Data Integration Process
1. Loaded CSV and JSON datasets using Pandas  
2. Executed SQL script to create restaurant tables in SQLite  
3. Merged datasets using **left joins** to retain all order records  
4. Created a final unified dataset for analysis  

---

## 📊 Analysis Performed
- Order trends over time  
- Revenue analysis by city and membership type  
- Cuisine-wise performance evaluation  
- Restaurant rating vs revenue analysis  
- Gold vs Regular membership behavior  
- Identification of high-value restaurants and users  

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- Gold members contribute significantly to total revenue  
- Certain cuisines generate higher average order values  
- High-rated restaurants tend to receive more orders  
- User membership plays a key role in revenue distribution  

---

## 📁 Final Output
- **final_food_delivery_dataset.csv** – Cleaned and merged dataset
- Jupyter Notebook containing:
  - Data loading
  - Data cleaning
  - Data merging
  - Analytical queries
  - Results and insights

---

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook
3. Run all cells sequentially
4. Ensure datasets are in the same directory as the notebook

---

## ✅ Conclusion
This project demonstrates practical skills in data integration, data analysis, and problem-solving using Python and SQL.  
It reflects a real-world analytics workflow suitable for data science and analytics roles.
